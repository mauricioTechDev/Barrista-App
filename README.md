#  ☕️ Barrista-App
### This application allows cashiers to input customer orders.  The orders can then only by accessed by baristas.  The baristas when they are logged in will be able to see the order.  When they have completed the order the application tags the baristas name to the completed drink.  Then the machine announces the name of the completed drink along with the customers name.
